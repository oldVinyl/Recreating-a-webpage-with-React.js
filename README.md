# Recreating-a-webpage-with-React.js
I recreated a webpage using the React.js JavaScript framework.

I simply broke the entire page down into 3 functional components: The Banner, The Gallery and The Footer. I developed each component separately and combined them in the App.js file.

I made use of display: flex and its properties to arrange each item on the page.
Each component has its own stylesheet, although there are a few styles that cut accross them.

There's not really much to say about this, considering its just visual and not functional, as per my task.
